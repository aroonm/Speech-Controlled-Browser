# Speech-Controlled-Browser

In this project, you’ll write a script that enables speech control of a web page on which it is included. It’s a little different this time because we will not be writing an extension. The reason is that due to permission restrictions, we can’t easily access the microphone (and, thus, speech recognition from an extension).
